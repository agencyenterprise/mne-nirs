GLM Analysis (Measured)
============================

In this example we analyse data from a real multichannel fNIRS
experiment (see :ref:`tut-fnirs-hrf-sim` for a simplified simulated
analysis). The experiment consists of three conditions
1) tapping with the left hand,
2) tapping with the right hand,
3) a control condition where the participant does nothing.
We use a GLM analysis to examine the neural activity associated with
the different tapping conditions.
An alternative epoching style analysis on the same data can be
viewed in the
:ref:`MNE documentation <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`.

This GLM analysis is a wrapper over the excellent
`Nilearn stats <https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/tree/master/nilearn/stats>`_.

Import raw NIRS data
--------------------

First we import the motor tapping data, these data are also
described and used in the
:ref:`MNE fNIRS tutorial <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`

After reading the data we resample down to 1Hz
to meet github memory constraints.

.. collapse:: Data description (click to expand)
   :class: success

   Optodes were placed over the motor cortex using the standard NIRX motor
   montage, but with 8 short channels added (see their web page for details).
   To view the sensor locations run
   `raw_intensity.plot_sensors()`.
   A sound was presented to indicate which hand the participant should tap.
   Participants tapped their thumb to their fingers for 5s.
   Conditions were presented in a random order with a randomised inter
   stimulus interval.

View experiment events
----------------------

Next we examine the timing and order of events in this experiment.
There are several options for how to view event information.
The first option is to use MNE's plot events command.
Here each dot represents when an event started.
We observe that the order of conditions was randomised and the time between
events is also randomised.

line is raised for the duration of the stimulus/condition.

Create design matrix
--------------------

.. sidebar:: Relevant literature

   For further discussion on design matrices see
   the Nilearn examples. Specifically the 
   `first level model <https://5712-1235740-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/plot_first_level_model_details.html>`_
   and 
   `design matrix examples <https://5712-1235740-gh.circle-artifacts.com/0/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level_models/plot_design_matrix.html>`_.

Next we create a model to fit our data to.
The model consists of various components to model different things we assume
contribute to the measured signal.
We model the expected neural response for each experimental condition
using the SPM haemodynamic response
function (HRF) combined with the known stimulus event times and durations
(as described above).
We also include a third order polynomial drift and constant to model
slow fluctuations in the data and a constant DC shift.

    design_matrix = make_first_level_design_matrix(raw_haemo,

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 190-195

We also add the mean of the short channels to the design matrix.
In theory these channels contain only systemic components, so including
them in the design matrix allows us to estimate the neural component
related to each experimental condition
uncontaminated by systemic effects.

.. code-block:: default

And we display a summary of the design matrix
using standard Nilearn reporting functions.
The first three columns represent the SPM HRF convolved with our stimulus
event information.
The next columns illustrate the drift and constant components.
The last columns illustrate the short channel signals.

Examine expected response
-------------------------

The matrices above can be a bit abstract as they encompase multiple 
conditons and regressors.
Instead we can examine a single condition.
Here we observe the boxcar function for a single condition,
this illustrates when the stimulus was active.
We also view the expected neural response using the HRF specified above,
we observe that each time a stimulus is presented there is an expected
brain response that lags the stimulus onset and consists of a large positive
component followed by an undershoot.

Fit GLM to subset of data and estimate response for each experimental condition

   implication on general linear models in functional near-infrared

We run a GLM fit for the data and experiment matrix.
First we analyse just the first two channels which correspond to HbO and HbR
of a single source detector pair.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 260-266

We then display the results. Note that the control condition sits
around zero
and that the HbO is positive and larger than the HbR, this is to be expected.
Further, we note that for this channel the response to tapping on the
right hand is larger than the left. And the values are similar to what
is seen in the epoching tutorial.

Lastly we can run the GLM analysis on all sensors and plot the result on a

We see the same result as in the MNE tutorial,
that activation is largest
contralateral to the tapping side. Also note that HbR tends to be the
negative of HbO as expected.

Here we export the data in a tidy pandas data frame.
We export the GLM results for every channel and condition.
Data is exported in long format by default.
However, a helper function is also provided to convert the long data to wide format.
The long to wide conversion also adds some additonal derived data, such as
if a significant response (p<0.05) was observed, which sensor and detector is
in the channel, which chroma, etc.

We can query the exported data frames to determine the true and false

the tapping, but we do expect 5% or less for the false positive rate.
