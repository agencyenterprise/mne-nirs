GLM Analysis (Measured)
============================

In this example we analyse data from a real multichannel fNIRS
experiment (see :ref:`tut-fnirs-hrf-sim` for a simplified simulated
analysis). The experiment consists of three conditions
1) tapping with the left hand,
2) tapping with the right hand,
3) a control condition where the participant does nothing.
We use a GLM analysis to examine the neural activity associated with
the different tapping conditions.
An alternative epoching style analysis on the same data can be
viewed in the
:ref:`MNE documentation <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`.

This GLM analysis is a wrapper over the excellent
`Nilearn GLM <http://nilearn.github.io/modules/reference.html#module-nilearn.glm>`_.

Import raw NIRS data
--------------------

First we import the motor tapping data, these data are also
described and used in the
:ref:`MNE fNIRS tutorial <mne:tut-fnirs-processing>`

After reading the data we resample down to 1Hz
to meet github memory constraints.

.. collapse:: Data description (click to expand)
   :class: success

   Optodes were placed over the motor cortex using the standard NIRX motor
   montage, but with 8 short channels added (see their web page for details).
   To view the sensor locations run
   `raw_intensity.plot_sensors()`.
   A sound was presented to indicate which hand the participant should tap.
   Participants tapped their thumb to their fingers for 5s.
   Conditions were presented in a random order with a randomised inter
   stimulus interval.

Create design matrix
--------------------

.. sidebar:: Relevant literature

   For further discussion on design matrices see
   the Nilearn examples. Specifically the 
   `first level model <http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level/plot_first_level_details.html>`_
   and 
   `design matrix examples <http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level/plot_design_matrix.html>`_.

Next we create a model to fit our data to.
The model consists of various components to model different things we assume
contribute to the measured signal.
We model the expected neural response for each experimental condition
using the SPM haemodynamic response
function (HRF) combined with the known stimulus event times and durations
(as described above).
We also include a third order polynomial drift and constant to model
slow fluctuations in the data and a constant DC shift.

We also add the mean of the short channels to the design matrix.
In theory these channels contain only systemic components, so including
them in the design matrix allows us to estimate the neural component
related to each experimental condition
uncontaminated by systemic effects.

Examine expected response
-------------------------

The matrices above can be a bit abstract as they encompase multiple 
conditions and regressors.
Instead we can examine a single condition.
Here we observe the boxcar function for a single condition,
this illustrates when the stimulus was active.
We also view the expected neural response using the HRF specified above,
we observe that each time a stimulus is presented there is an expected
brain response that lags the stimulus onset and consists of a large positive
component followed by an undershoot.

Fit GLM to subset of data and estimate response for each experimental condition

We run a GLM fit for the data and experiment matrix.
First we analyse just the first two channels which correspond to HbO and HbR
of a single source detector pair.

We then display the results. Note that the control condition sits
around zero
and that the HbO is positive and larger than the HbR, this is to be expected.
Further, we note that for this channel the response to tapping on the
right hand is larger than the left. And the values are similar to what
is seen in the epoching tutorial.

Fit GLM to all data and view topographic distribution
-----------------------------------------------------

Lastly we can run the GLM analysis on all sensors and plot the result on a
topomap.
We see the same result as in the MNE tutorial,
that activation is largest
contralateral to the tapping side. Also note that HbR tends to be the
negative of HbO as expected.

Note that the topographic visualisation is a high level representation
of the underlying data. This visual representation fits a smoothed surface
to the data and makes many assumptions including that the data is
spatially smooth and that the sensors sufficiently cover the scalp surface.
These assumptions can be violated with fNIRS due to the improved spatial
sensitivity (relative to EEG) and typically low number of sensors that are
unevenly distributed over the scalp.
As such, researchers should understand the underlying data and ensure that
the figure accurately reflects the effect of interest.

As an example of how the topoplot can be deceiving, we replot
the `Tapping/Right` condition from above for each hemisphere
separately. When both hemisphere are plotted together (left),
the function smooths
the large space between sensors, making the activity on the left hemisphere
smear towards the center and appear larger than the underlying data shows.
When each hemisphere is plotted independently (right) it becomes immediately
apparent that the data does not indicate that activity spreads across
the center of the head.

Analyse regions of interest

Or alternatively we can summarise the responses across regions of interest
for each condition. And you can plot it with your favorite software.

Compute contrasts
-----------------

We can also define a contrast as described in
`Nilearn docs <http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/04_glm_first_level/plot_localizer_surface_analysis.html>`_
and plot it.
Here we contrast the response to tapping on the left hand with the response
from tapping on the right hand.

Export Results
---------------

.. sidebar:: Relevant literature

   Wickham, Hadley. "Tidy data." Journal of Statistical Software 59.10 (2014): 1-23.

Here we export the data in a tidy pandas data frame.
We export the GLM results for every channel and condition.
Data is exported in long format by default.
However, a helper function is also provided to convert the long data to wide format.
The long to wide conversion also adds some additional derived data, such as
if a significant response (p<0.05) was observed, which sensor and detector is
in the channel, which chroma, etc.

Determine true and false positive rates
---------------------------------------

We can query the exported data frames to determine the true and false
positive rates. Note: optodes cover a greater region than just the
motor cortex, so we dont expect 100% of channels to detect responses to
the tapping, but we do expect 5% or less for the false positive rate.
